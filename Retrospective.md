## Experience

I struggled a bit with adding all the flair and content to my site, but it was a fun way of learning and got me all kinds of experence. I would just run into small issues or have trouble knowing what to call to make what I wanted, and just googling it gave me some good help. I was most confused about the TypeScript part of this assignment and what exactly we have to implement, the way I understood it we only need a helloWorld which is all I added, but I wasn't sure if we needed more. I was able to get the whole project done and I had some fun doing it and learning all kinds of new css technics and skills.

## Known issues or Bugs

Some of the images can clip outside of the containers they are in if the size of them gets small enough. The only other issue 
I wasn't able to fix was to center the color changing title, it centers every line after the first one but not the first (I think it 
has to do with the way it was built).
